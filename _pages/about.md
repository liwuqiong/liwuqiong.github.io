Hi, I'm Rick.  

I am an on-the-way entreprenuer trying to make something useful for the industry.
I also love creating things so as to be a writer and an indie hacker. 
On the whole, I haven't made any brilliant achievements till now. Just some regular success with much failure that are not worth mentioning.
Beacuse I wasted lots of time and opportunites in the past.

I decided to work on myself to make a complete change. 
It's a hard but the right way.

This daily blog carries what I see and think during the journey.

Maybe a different and interesting one.
