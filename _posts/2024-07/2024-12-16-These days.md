In the last 3 weeks, I have been watching udemy related courses, mainly Python, as well as some about AI, machine learning, and data analysis. 

I can confirm that this is really something I enjoy, because programming involves two main characteristics: determinism and creativity. 

Some days are basically programmed all day, only in this way, can break through the card points that have been repeated before. 

In the middle of many ambiguous, similar and no clear understanding of the concept, at any time to check GPT and Wenxin dialogue, are basically clear.

I felt like I was finally getting in the door and starting to see things from a developer's perspective.
