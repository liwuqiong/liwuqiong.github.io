Become interested in Ayn Land and her thoughts these days. Reading books and essays about her biography and philosophy, I accept her point on individualism against collectivism. I was born in China, one of the only few remained countries that still adhere to the so-called socialism ideology. In fact, most people here just want to make more many by all means. They want more and more others to sacrifice while pursue individual benefits themselves. They are the the ones who really exploit the people. 

I hate this atmosphere full of hypocrisy, making me disgusting and disappointing.
