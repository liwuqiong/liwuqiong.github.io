An editor of a publishing house recommends me to write a book. The theme could be related to something like data, AI application, product, traffic monetization an so on.

That's a challenge to me, and also a "should do" thing. I like writing, why not write a book to make a real start?

Besides, it could be a way of pushing me into a long-term project. 

In this world, I have nothing much to pursue in the end. But writing something really useful would be one of these few things.
