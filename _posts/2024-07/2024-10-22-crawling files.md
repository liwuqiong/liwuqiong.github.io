Learning programming and python is like a marathon for me. It took more than 10 years sporadically. No one time the endeavor lasted more than several months. Things should've not been like this. What a loser.

I've restarted my learning by conducting real projects. From an article I try to learn how to crawl SEC 10-K files through its API by using python. Wish a good start.
