The result of GMAT exam reminded me of my unstable English basics. My English was not poor and each time I could get a high score in the past. But it was not strong enough for GMAT exam. Besides, I had not studied and exercised English for many years, i.e. the the level of my English had no improvement. That's really bad. 

Thanks to GMAT. It's an alert. 

I started reading English newspapers magazines as a daily routine. The list included Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Economist and so on. I can understand most of articles, but some unfamiliar words and sophisticated sentences still exist making the understanding difficult. Also, my oral and writing skill are far from good compared to reading. 

I must take it seriously promoting my English ability as a whole. 

Besides, I found on my hard disk some documents which outline several projects planning to do. The content is nearly all the same as what I try to do these years. What astonished me most is that the documents were made in 2014-2016, nearly 10 years ago. 

I felt a little depressed. From this I saw why I didn't success in so many years. I was always lingering in the same place. The goals were set, the plans were made, but the execution was just shit. No follow-up, just several dot-like reviews after several months occasionally, and then refreshed the plan's end time. 

To jump out of this loop which I see as the most common symbol of a typical loser, I write this daily blog as a monitor or a tool that drags my attention to adhere to the goal and plan. 

The source mainly comes from three: 
- the most important goal and work weekly,
- the daily to-do plan, 
- and the retrospect. 

The content mainly focuses on the progress and thought. 

In this way, I hope I can start a brand new next 10 years that are totally different from the past one. I've already lived a life full of peace and happiness. I will start chasing a much more broad and splendid future. Not stopped by fear, hesitation, inconsecutive endeavor and lack of willingness and determination. I've wasted too much time. That's the past unnecessary to be recalled back and shed tears. Just look at the right now and tomorrow. 

After ll, tomorrow is another day.
