There are some English words that I don't comprehend thoroughly while encountering them frequently. One of those is "relentless". 

Till now, I may understand it more deeply. It's an attitude, behavior and choice from the bottom of the heart, especially when the days are getting hard and difficult. 

In such case, it would be too bad and stupid that indulging one's inner emotion as an escape. 

The bottom line is strict: don't stop doing stuff and going forward no matter how difficult it is or how unwilling you are. Bon't break your own rule. Just keep moving. 

That is what I see "relentless".
