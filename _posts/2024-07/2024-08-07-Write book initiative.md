Recite many new words. Also some exercises on long&sophisticated sentences. A good restart from the very basics that were neglected before.

I have also another project in content creation: Writing a book. This is also a thing planned to do very early(could be traced back to 2016) but never really done. I would do it seriously and continuously in this year. In recent days I am trying to come up with the table of contents as a proposal for launch. The theme may focus on AI and data product. 

My A1 project still remains staggering. I adjusted my attitude in the beginning of August. I'm thankful for my remote working mode right now and must take full advantage of it. And I would do my best in my part.
