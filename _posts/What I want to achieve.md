In one's whole life, there may not be many things worth doing with full heart. In fact, having done only one work well is by no means a waste of life. 

So the dedicated things, should be selected carefully in terms of what you really want to do or what you're good at to do.

For me, there are several things with achievements that I commit myself to do. 

1. Launch a business with cool products. The business thrives well that helps the economy boom and myself escape from the constraints of money.
2. Write multiple essays and several books. I want to communicate my story and thoughts to the worlds with an elegant usage of words.
3. Conduct research to come up with theories. I hope to find the fact and give it a better explanation, and throw what I've found into real world. 

These are what I want to achieve. When I'm near dying, I wish I could have done them, no matter how well or badly.
