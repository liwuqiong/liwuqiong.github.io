In 2024, I set some goals for myself:

1. As a cofounder, make the company survive and thrive.
2. Earn enough money from various ways to escape the debt and going abroad. Main way: develop a profitable app independently.
3. Write 1 book and 100 articles. 
4. Prepare for going aboard to start a new life.

No bullshit. 

Let's start.
