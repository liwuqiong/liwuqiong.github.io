Our company opens in today's morning. A day worth celebrating. 

The co-founders all come. We invite our angel investors come too. We have a small and happy opening celebration. 

In the noon we have a lunch.

I'm now in the hotel writing this post. To be frank, I'm not exited. Just peaceful. 

I don't know whether we will succeed this time. 

But I have faith that we will make a difference. I will make the thing happen.
