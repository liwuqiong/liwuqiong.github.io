Entropy is everywhere. Once you are careless, things would definitely go into a mess. It's a fight in your heart and soul. It's a physical labour that needs sweat and blood. Don't think be natural at all time. You have to intervene when it's inclining to go bad. 

It's not an entertainment. 

It's a war.
