Certainly I'm quite aware of the importance of momentum. I've written a [post](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/09/08/momentum) about it. 

The last two weeks were an example of momentum stagnation. I felt low. I didn't want to do anything. I tried to encourage myself to cheer up but failed. Just like escaping Hulk in the movie 'The Avengers 4'. 

But there were no Thanos who had beaten Hulk in seconds. My situation were much more simple. 

I just didn't start. 

And in the time, so many bad habits came in. Sleeping late, playing games, getting up late, and wasting time on meaningless swiping cellphone...

A bad time.
