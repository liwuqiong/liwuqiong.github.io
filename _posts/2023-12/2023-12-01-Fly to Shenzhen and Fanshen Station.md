I went on a business trip to Shenzhen from today till next weekend. Beijing is in cold winter. Just after about 6 hours, I landed where was still like summer. 

In order to save money for the startup, the airline and hotel were both the cheapest. Uncomfortable trip and place to sleep. Quite different from when I was in large company with no consideration about these costs. 

Why I leave my comfortable home and family to this place?

This is the journey what I choose. 

I must have our work done. 

Btw, my hotel locates the road(and near the subway station) whose name is Fanshen, meaning turn over in English. 

I hope this is a start of turning over from the bad days to beautiful good days tomorrow.
