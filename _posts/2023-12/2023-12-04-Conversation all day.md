I have an appointment with my friend ZX today in the morning. And the conversation ends in the evening. 

We talked about the start-up work, family and thoughts. The work had so many problems from product, technology to management, human resource. We must face and solve them one by one. ZX and his wife just had got a baby, and they were in the hotel for a rest right now. I went to visit and the baby was so cute. I gave my bless. 

Then we went out and took a walk along the seaside, till to a bookstore having a cup of tea. There we talked about something about personal growth and philosophy. We had common value base with different views and angles toward life. The talk was so meaningful.

We also talked about the past experience of working like starting a business, writing a book, content creation and so on. Not much was successful. I think the main reason was the execution was bad. 

After that we went to the basement parking to test the new car. He just bought a new Tesla Model Y but still not familiar with how to park. I set an examples several times. In the end he managed to park more smoothly. 

This day was a different one in this business trip in Shenzhen. I must be different in discipline in the first place so as to make a real difference. 

Always be on the track. Never ever give up.
