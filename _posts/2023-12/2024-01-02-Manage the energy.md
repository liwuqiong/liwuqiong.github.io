The version 0.8 is near end. I've started to check and accept the product. 

Boss's ideas change many times, so we have to make adjustments accordingly during the period of coding. Maybe that's why startups always change.

I've read an article on HBR about energy management. The author points out that the idea of time management is out of date. The real thing to do is to manage your energy. To do that, there are four pillars: 
- Body. Ensure sleep and exercise to maintain the basic level of energy. 
- Emotion. Keep peaceful and avoid the role of a victim. 
- Mind. Be focused. 
- Spirit. Find the meaning of work and life. 

I'd read the article about 10 years ago when I was still in postgraduate study. This time it touches me more deeply.

I have some daily routines that must be done, including the habits of sleeping early, getting up early and doing exercises. I also tell myself to do anything to keep in a good state. 

This article enlightens me that all the efforts could be guided by the four ways. A good state is the one with those four that all are good. I should be aware of and proactive to keeping the balance of these four areas.
