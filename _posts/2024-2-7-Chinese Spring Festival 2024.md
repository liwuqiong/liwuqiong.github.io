In Chinese tradition Spring Festival is a happy time when the whole family get together and celebrate. We may eat and drink, wear new clothes, let off fireworks, visit relatives... 

I like it very much when I was a kid. As the age grows, the excited feeling fades away.

But in general, it's still a special time that signals one year's end and the beginning of another. 

For many Chinese, only when the Spring Festival passes by that a new year truly starts.

Especially, because of the government's strict Covid-19 policy, many Chinese haven't been home for Spring Festival for 2-3 years. 

When I come back, I'm happy as before. 

But how much time passes by? I can't really tell. It seems that nothing happens during these years. People has no memory about what they have experienced and how much they have lost.
