When I joined my A1 project as co-founder, I come up with a company domain name called Socradata.com, which stems from the combination of Socrates and Data implying the asking intelligence of the product. The proposal is not adopted in the end. 

But I like it so much that I buy it myself. For the last few months I was thinking what it could be used for. 

Now I decide to use it to be a website publishing the news and comments about the theme focusing data application and digital transformation, including AI, GPT, LLM, data tech, marketing tech and so on. 

In the daily work I keep absorbing info and insights on certain areas and making notes and comments, which could be the source of the content. It's also an asset that's worth spreading with others. It's the tech side of myself and a spur to keep reading and publishing.

Let it be my second project in content creation.
