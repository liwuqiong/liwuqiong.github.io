Writing this daily blog(I hope it could exist as a daily base) is mainly three disciplines:

1. Indie hacker: as an IH one should polish his skill and mind regularly to resist the powerful tendency of entropy. 
2. Writing: I use it as a way to practice my English writing. Maybe one day I could write a book in English.
3. Track: Track the way I'm walking and set a framework that no matter what I do and think, I would go back to this place to take a rest at the end of one day. Thus, I would say that "Tomorrow is another day".

I believe that if I would do something wonderful and meaningful, the number one must is the enthusiasm. I should find and develop love of what I'm doing, so as to take whole endeavor into it. 

Each time I feel depressed and don't like to do anything, I would remind myself of turning back to the very start: Why am I doing this? How much do I love it? What is the end of my life?

Then I know that I should put the bad mood aside, and just do from the very tiny things. 

Be loving this world. Be a doer. And be stronger.
