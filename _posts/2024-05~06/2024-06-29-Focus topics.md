I've written a lot posts about focus on the most important work that has real impact on myself and the future. But each time the focus goes to distracted after several days or weeks. 

That is one type of entropy. 

To resist it this daily post has the responsibility, in the way of monitor or retrospect. 

Although the post's writing is free to express my thought about anything, there should be some main topics to be covered and reviewed regularly, ranging from my work&progress on indie hacker, content creation and entrepreneur journey, to the thought and insight stemming from them.

That is the where focus lies in.
