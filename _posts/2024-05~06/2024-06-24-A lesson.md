It's a strange thing that we are still struggling with what is PMF and how to find it. We have tried some, but none of them seem successful in the market. Our founder comes up with many ideas frequently, each of which lasts no more than two weeks with replacement by the next. There are lots of problems in work and teamwork. It sucks.

As a co-founder, and just only one of the co-founders, I have no much space of speaking power.

But one thing is clear: I must be the decision guy and developer myself. Only one exception: I have a boss that takes my advice seriously. 

A good lesson, anyway.
