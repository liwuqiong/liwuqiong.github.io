Just read a post about an AI search application made by a domestic indie hacker. The site attracts more than 60k traffic worldwide, indicating that the PMF stage has been found. 

Then I search the author and know that he resigned last year to be an indie hacker. Similar story like me and also a guy with no willingness to work for others. 

But the difference is I am not bold and working hard enough. I put too much effort into my co-founding work in which I have little influence. I hate that. As a result, I devote no time into my own IH learning and project. That's a big mistake. 

I should be more brave to pursue the things that really inspire me. That's the essence and original intention of my quit from office work last year. 

Only guided by the real enthusiasm can I make outstanding achievements or be happy. At least one should be seized. 

The most important things to be focused: 

1. Apply for PHD degree abroad;
2. Learning to be an indie hacker by doing;
3. Writing.
