Read several hours about Sartre and his existential philosophy. Tracing the line I go back to Nietzsche again and try to gain more and deeper understanding. 

I have read these two giants' work several months and years ago. Astonished and inspired by their astounding words. 

Also, I read Aynland's Fountainhead, another masterwork that makes me rethink how to live a meaningful life and whom I really want to be.

I refresh my view of life. They are my new mentors.
