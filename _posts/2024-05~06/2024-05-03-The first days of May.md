It's Labor's day and the holiday lasts for 5 days from May 1st to 5th. There's always been too much people in almost all attractions in such holidays. It's the Chinese style of holiday. 

I stay in Beijing instead of going back to Zhengzhou which is the first idea. 

In the first day I and my wife go to a large book store. After that we take a city walk to a wonderful civic park, where beautiful flowers attract much attention. 

In the second day we go to climb mountain in the suburb. The climbing is a little hard for me, because I haven't got exercise in such intensity. 

Also, there is a famous temple in the mountain. Some genius have had chosen to be monks in there. The temple is quite and beautiful. I feel my mind be washed. 

After coming back from the mountain, I spend hours preparing for the exam. This is a must to do nearly everyday. 

Besides, my wife asks me to teach her how to drive. The teaching has been going on every weekend for several weeks.

Today the 3rd of May, I stay home, doing my own work till afternoon. May be I would take a walk outside later. 

This how I spend the first days of May.
