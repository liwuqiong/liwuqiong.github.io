GMAT
Review the mistakes I made in the exercise of reading comprehension yesterday night. After more than one month's exercise I drew a conclusion that my weakness was verbal including RC and CR, and the main reason was reading speed. On average the I spend more nearly 3 minutes per question. That doesn't work in real exam definitely.

Learning Python restarted yesterday and went on today. The focus was put on difficult and key parts: function and classes. I must master how to write and use them. I've also upgraded and deepened my understanding of some key concepts like data structure and data type. It really helped that I started to be fond of computer science because of its simplicity and complexity.

For my co-founding part, I've made a little research on Salesforce.com and its product line for a designing work of a similar function. Large company has its way. I must find out my own. I also have a discussion about the demands recently in detail. 
In general, the startup is in danger. We have little time left but just several months, if the next round financing fails.
I don't know where it would go, but just do my best on my part. But no matter what the result is, what I learned from this lesson is clear: I must be my own boss.
