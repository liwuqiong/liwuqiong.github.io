There is up and down as you step your feet forward, just like tides' rising and falling. My falling lasts for about two months, during which I got lost. For this, the indie hacker work suspended without any progress. 

From today on, I regain my strength and decide to go back to the track. The echo is still laudable that I hear it from another side of reality: I have no net income from this month on. 

It means that my cash flow would be negative because of the housing mortgage. 

It's the first time for me to feel dangerous and worried about my finance status. The reality is always the most effective trigger for one to speed up and take real actions. I have not much time to make the reverse. The freedom of entrepreneur and freelance is costly. 

If I don't find a way to make an income, I must go back to the office job where I definitely don't want to go to. Let alone whether I can find or not a high payable job like before in this stagnant economy day 

Dream is wakening. 

Fight for living. Fight for freedom.
