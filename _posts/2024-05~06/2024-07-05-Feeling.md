People are also important. That's what I always neglect in the past. I should take other people's feeling into consideration. If agreement can't be reached because each side has own strong opinion and won't give in, then let the conversation be peaceful instead of turning it into a debate. That's a wise policy. After all, it's a work contributed by many and nor ultimately responsible by you, don't take it too much seriously.
