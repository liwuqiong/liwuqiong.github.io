I have said many times that I don't have full control in the project A1 in the previous posts, which makes me unhappy each time when it encounters the occasion reminding me of it.

I think that I should spend more time on the things that I have full control of. I realize that I'm the kind of person who has to be the one have the final say, or at least has much power on the decision. I must host the general. 

The projects of Indie hacker, and Writing, and others are my sub-focus in the next few months.
