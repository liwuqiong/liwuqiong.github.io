Time is such a thing that if you don't care about it with your heart you'll soon find out that you're dumped without any goodbye. 

"To make each day count", is a hard but worthwhile lifestyle to be practiced. 

This is why I persist on this daily blog, even if no one else sees it or my awkward writing English. 

It monitors my life going on well or bad or just so-so. The most obvious indicator is the pace of writing. 

Just a small neglect on self-discipline would lead to several day's absence of writing update. As a matter of fact, it's the period when I don't have a plan on what's needed to do, and most projects don't have much progress.

This is a mirror of myself and my life. 

So don't let it down. 

Let it shine.
