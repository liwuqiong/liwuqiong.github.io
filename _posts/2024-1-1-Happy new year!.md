The new year 2024 has come. It seems that so many people are unhappy for one whole year, and here comes an opportunity to leash out. They go out at the threshold eve to celebrate and yell. 

I am not one of them. My 2023 is a infection point for me, and I'm full of hope and happiness to welcome my 2024. I can't wait to catch up and run forward. 

Another thing to write down. My kid who was just 2 years old had a fever and cough at 2 a.m. in the  morning, my wife and I were worried didn't sleep well the whole night. In the morning we went to hospital and bought some medicine. Fortunately everything was fine. I stay home whole day to accompany my kid. 

He's my angle and may god bless him.

Happy new year!
