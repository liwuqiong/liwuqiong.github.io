Sleeping is always a major and basic problem for me. One is sleep late at night, and the other is that sleep too much at noon. 

The bad habit breaks the structure and balance of a whole day. Especially in the afternoon I feel quite bad and thus so unproductive. The time is wasted.

There are mainly two ways to improve this situation:
1. Block all of the fragments and noises from apps
2. Draw the two bottom-lines that can't be passed: 
	1. Be on bed no late than 00:30; 
	2. Get up at noon no late than 14:30;

It's certainly true that my productivity would be upgraded to a new level if the sleeping problem were solved.
