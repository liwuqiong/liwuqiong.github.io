There are various ways to reboot oneself. I have to figure out what fits me. 

In the previous post, I set the baseline: body. I have already regain a good sleep. 

Next, the planning would be like the to do list below: 

- Exercise: Start regular aerobic exercise besides swimming: running. Prepare the basic equipment for running. Run for at least 20 minutes each afternoon, with about 20 minutes' anaerobic exercise. 
- Write: Write down all what I want to say: how I kill the momentum; what bad habits had done on my body and spirit; how I feel these days; what I plan to do to end all this mess and restart the momentum. 
- Reemphasize the importance of good sleeping: ensure at least 7 hours' sleep by sleep before 23:30. 
- Keep simple: No more fragmented information. Just import content from a few sources. 
- Focus: Always keep in mind what's the most important thing to do right now by doing small planning and adjusting in real time.
