It's near Chinese Spring Festival which is at 2-9. 

Today I drive home from Beijing to Zhengzhou, a provincial capital in the middle of China. 

I haven't been home for celebrating Spring Festival for 4 years since the pandemic of Covid-19. The Chinese government did't allow or advocate people go home for fear of virus spreading due to large population movement. 

So long for 4 years. But so quick when I recall it, just like a glimpse. 

I feel sad for myself and the people in this land.
