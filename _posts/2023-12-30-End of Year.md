The year 2023 is near to the end. I have not much to say about it. For me, 2023 is a brand new start to a new kind of life, meaning that I say goodbye to the old version of me. 

In my whole life it's the very first time that I start to both consider thoroughly and execute quickly for living my own life and doing my own thing. I call it an awaken version of me. Although it comes a little late, we have it anyway, and it's definitely a good thing.

I've experienced various kinds of people and things. It's foolish to be timid or degrade myself. I have the full confidence for my work.

No crap. Look ahead.
