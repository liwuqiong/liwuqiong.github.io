Life is like a spiral rotation. The difference is whether you choose to be upward or downward.

After one week's low productivity that suspends the previous momentum, I try to make the change. 

I sleep two hours this noon to recharge the energy after many days' staying up late. The broken balance also destroy my willingness to do anything. 

Restart the habit construction of sleeping early. This is the [rules](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/11/16/start-to-build-habits-of-healthy-life) I set for myself several weeks ago(only last for about two weeks):

> - **Sleeping**: Sleep early and regularly to ensure 8 hours(7 hours better at least) sleep. Learn to sleep well and rest well is the most urgent and the most important issue I'm facing. 
> - **Sport**: Start exercise regularly to keep energetic and fit. One specific is to lost weight about 5 kg. 
> - **Appearance**: Pay more and serious attention to body caring and clothing decoration. Stop being too slovenly. A nice appearance is helpful for self-confidence and good mental status. And it's also a clear message transmitted outwardly about one's attitude to life. 
> - **Tiny habits**: 
> 	- **Don't sit too long**: Stand up and take a walk every 40-60 minutes while doing desk work.
> 	- **On diet**: Eat less with no heavy and spicy food. Drink less. Resist the temptation indulging myself. 
> 	- **Walk after dinner**: Take a small walk after dinner to help digestion and mind clarification.

Remind the importance of the habits above again. Go back to the track. 

There would still be much more times of these reboot/restart games. I know it definitely. 

My goal is to make the time between two reboots longer, and the time in the reboot shorter. 

For this, I have to be quite careful for any causes that may damage the momentum, and I have to find out more efficient reboot methods. 

The basic is that don't break the time framework that ensures the balance. Sleep early and getup early, and exercise regularly. 

I read about Haruki Murakami's life being a novelist. His lifestyle is a good example for me.

Body is the baseline. Then comes energy.
