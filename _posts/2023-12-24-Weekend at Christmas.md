This weekend I attended a wedding ceremony. Warm one. 

Then I brought my family to shopping mall. 

For me, Christmas Eve is a time to celebrate the whole year, and also a time to recall the past and look ahead the future. 

In China, government media always guides the public opinion to the wrong side. This time it makes people feel guilty and shameful for the Christmas again, because it's a foreigners' holiday. 

That's how Chinese government does things. I don't give a shit to comment. 

It's a place without freedom and democracy. No hope for most ordinary people.
