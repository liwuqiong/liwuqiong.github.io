I would like to organize my learning activities to make it more clear and efficient.

Two lines: 

For project
- 


For knowledge


Learning could be three in various forms. Don't restrict to reading, although it's still one of the most important. 
- Read
- Course
- Talk with experts and the right people
- Experience
- Field study
- Desk study
- Practice
- Exercise
