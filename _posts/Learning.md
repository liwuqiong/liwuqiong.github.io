I would like to organize my learning activities to make it more clear and efficient.

Two lines: 
- For project
- For knowledge

## Learning for project

For project line, it's flexible to learn what the project's goal needs to learn. To know or understand something, or to learn the skills. 

Learning could be three in various forms. Don't restrict it in reading, although it's still one of the most important. 
- Read
- Course
- Talk with experts and the right people
- Experience
- Field study
- Desk study
- Practice
- Exercise

In this line, I have several learning stable areas: 
1. Entrepreneur basics in real world: mindset and methodology
2. GPT, LLM and AI
3. Product design
4. Big data and BI products&tech
5. Programming skills: CS basics; Python; Web
6. Writing: large input of literature

## Learning for knowledge

For knowledge line, it's mainly for a larger base and a broader horizon. So the learning themes covers multiple but focusing areas:
1. Management and Economics
2. History
3. Others subject: philosophy; humanity; sociology; art; maths; physics; 

## Curiosity driven learning

The learning tasks are mainly driven by theme or question/assumption. 

It means that in most cases, I'm not learning just for learning itself. 

Instead, the learning action is the respond to the curiosity, which is crucial to the motivation to purchase knowledge, skill and the truth.

## Learning task deployment

The tasks in learning for project are *flexible according to the actual needs as a daily task*, except for two stable tasks that are at regular basis:
- Programming skills: *Weekday of  1, 3, 5, 7*
- Writing: *Weekday of 2,4,6*

The tasks in learning for knowledge are deployed as daily routine, which is supposed to be done at noon.
