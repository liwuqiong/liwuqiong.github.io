I want to find a way to create content at large scale. This way might be more of exercise intention instead of just intrinsic. There should be dozens of essays published at first to make a basic launch. And then it might be the time to write several articles with careful revision. 

The way is serious or vertical writing. I think it might work so I would like to test it.

Serious/Vertical Writing list:
- Reading comment
- Movie comment
- Business comment
- GPT/AI knowledge basics
- Python programming basics
- History 
- Thoughts
- Data tech and Martech knowledge basics
- Summarize the podcast that I have listened
- News

I would like to produce content in batch according to the list above.
