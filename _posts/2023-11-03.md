In my project A1, I don't have a full control. I have to do what others tell me to do. I am not the one that initiate things. It's just another kind of office work. The different part is that I have more stock share in it, ~~and may have more power~~. That's all.

It's a place to be more free to do work. It's a venture capital in a form of a self commitment. 

It's not a place that suits my dream work.
