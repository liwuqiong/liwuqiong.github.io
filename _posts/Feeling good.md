When you know what you're doing, and most things start to get onto the track and be in the control, you would feel good. Because you know that everything's getting fine. You are closer to your goal. 

I end the last low state period and reboot again. The spiral rotation start to go upward. 

I make a progress about interviewing and recruiting two interns. And start to solve some tedious problems during the development. We are on the way to develop the Version 0.8 after I finish the design work.  

I begin the running exercise today for more than 2 kilometers. Not much comparing to the previous 5 kilometers, but a good start.

I feel good. 

There are still something remain not started. I must complete the training set of questions. I must restart the learning of python. I must make the writing work regularly. 

Don't panic. Just do it, one by one.
