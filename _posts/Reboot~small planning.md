There are various ways to reboot oneself. I have to figure out what fits me. 

In the previous post, I set the baseline: body. I have already made a good sleep. 

Next, the planning would be like the to do list below: 

- **Exercise**: Start regular aerobic exercise besides the swimming class: running. Prepare the basic equipment for running. Run for at least 20 minutes each afternoon, with about 20 minutes' anaerobic exercise. 
- **Write**: Write down all what I want to say: how I kill the momentum; what bad habits had done on my body and spirit; how I feel these days; what I plan to do to end all this mess and restart the momentum. 
- **Reemphasize**: 
	- the importance of good sleeping: ensure at least 7 hours' sleep by sleep before 23:30, to keep basic energy.
	- knowledge management task daily: import, read, sort, export, share. 
- **Keep simple**: No more fragmented information. Just import content from a few high-quality sources. 
- **Focus**: 
	- Always keep in mind what's the most important thing to do right now by doing small planning and adjusting in real time. 
	- And list the to-dos in the near time:
		- A1: product design;
		- A2: learn python;
		- A3: Keep pace of writing by writing at least 3 articles one week for blog_zh and socrodata.com and sharing as daily routine.
