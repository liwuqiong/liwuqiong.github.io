I quit my job last month not only to start my own projects as a new entrepreneur journey, but also to build new habits to lead a healthy life. 

A healthy lifestyle is actually what I need at the foremost above all things. Yes, I say "above all things", meaning that more important than conducting projects. 

It's the basic foundation that influences all my work, study, body, relationship and personal and family life. 

I escape from the past time to end both the work mode in the office company and the life mode with no caring about real important things. It doesn't mean I'm not aware of the caring, but that I never succeed because of being in that work mode. 

Work and life are so highly related and connected that if one is in the bad status then the other would be sinking down and reversely affecting back. This imbalance leads to downward spiral where I hardly survive out. 

So I break up the chain by quitting one leading factor: Work mode. Now I've start my own projects both as entrepreneurial cofounder and content creator(in the future as indie hacker). I have nearly fully control of my time. 

Then I'm going to rebuild my lifestyle, to enhance the working efficiency and to lead a better and healthier life. 

It's a typical example of doing the hard but right thing. And I put it in the No.1 priority above all the others.

Here is the list: 
- **Sleeping**: Sleep early and regularly to ensure 8 hours(7 hours better at least) sleep. Learn to sleep well and rest well is the most urgent and the most important issue I'm facing. 
- **Sport**: Start exercise regularly to keep energetic and fit. One specific is to lost weight about 5 kg. 
- **Appearance**: Pay more and serious attention to body caring and clothing decoration. Stopping too slovenly. A nice appearance is good for confidence and mental status. And it's also a clear message transmitted outwardly about one's attitude to life. 
- **Tiny habits**: 
	- **Don't sit too long**: stand up and take a walk every 40-60 minutes while doing desk work.
	- **On diet**: eat less with no heavy and spicy food. Drink less. Resist the temptation indulging myself. 

The brand new habits don't need much time to take. Instead, they need awareness and persistence. Be alert enough at every tiny daily fork and make the right choice. Things get better based on these many small choices one by one. 

But the hardest part is the shift of mindset: I don't really take the habits above seriously, although admit their importance every time speaking of them and have tried so many times to build them. 

It's another typical example of gap between thought and action. The main reason is that I have never set the right mindset to put those habits in the No.1 place. 

In the case of sleeping habit. I set schedule to sleep early many times, but other things like work, reading and even swiping mobile phone or playing computer games, could easily get in and postpone the scheduled sleeping time. Although I know I should go to bed to gain a good status, however the result is always staying up late repeatedly. 

The mindset shift is to recognize the significance of good habits from the bottom of heart. 

For completing this shift:
- I read a lot about the importance and benefits of sleeping well, and prepare to go to bed in advance as a ceremony. 
- No digital staff after 23 p.m. Just like you should drop your pen down in an exam when it gets to the finish time.(Can you imagine continuing writing after the exam ends?) 
- Nothing could prioritize ahead when it's time to sleep. 

Here is the start. Hope I could build this in the long run. I will report the progress here as a monitoring mechanism. 

Let's see. Bless me.
