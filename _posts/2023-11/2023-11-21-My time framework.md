Time framework is what I use to make the work flow more smoothly and automatically. 

I have [an edition](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/10/23/back-into-control) of it one month ago. Now I would like to update it.

I divide my whole day into 2 large blocks and 5 small blocks(or fragment time). These blocks have its own time period while also are flexible among each in start&end time. 

(*Maybe it could be called 2+5 framework for short*)

**Large blocks:**
- Morning: 9-12;  // for the startup 
- Afternoon: 14-17; //for indie hacker

**Small blocks:**
- Before morning: about 8-9; //for km-a(news)
- noon: 12-14; (actual 1 hour) //for km-b(reading)
- nightfall: 17-18; //for exercising
- night1: 19-20:30;  //for writing
- night2: 21:30-23:00; //for km-c(retaining); km-d(sharing);

Among the blocks: //for km(a, b, c, d)

In the weekend, I would like to take a rest by sparing more time for myself and my family.

It's another topic that learning how to rest and renew scientifically and effectively. I did badly in it and wasted a lot time. Must be ending.
