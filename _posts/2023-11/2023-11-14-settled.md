My second blog, which is written in Chinese, is established. Another time of spending lots of time searching proper theme, configuring the details and looking for solutions when I encounter annoying problems. 

I have the confidence to say that I've already met most of problems while building a jekyll blog and get the answer to them, including those quite rarely seen, and watched most of  the jekyll themes on the market,  covering all theme sites and most popular recommendation articles.

I won't see those staff any more. Don't make troubles for myself. 

Just start WRITING.
