I solve the problem of image uploading configuration using a cloud storage service. Again this time that many little problems along the way. 

I realize that problems are impossible to be solved all at once, just like work can't be done all.  It emerges one by one. As long as you want to do something, it is just there to be found. 

So I stop here. 

As to the left unsolved small problems or bugs, just leave them alone and let them go. Maybe I will solve them when I have more solid knowledge(especially front-end) in the future.

- navbar and article list shown in one screen on mobile phone;
- solve the tag thing thoroughly;
- add a title above the navbar;
- add reading count number to posts and pages;
- make the website open faster;
- make the mini about me module shown on mobile phone;
- filter myself's visit out from Google Analytics data

Go back to do the content creating work.
