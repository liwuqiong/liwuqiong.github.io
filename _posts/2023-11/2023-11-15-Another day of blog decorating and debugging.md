After I wrote "settled" last day, which was supposed to make a closure to the new Chinese blog configuring thing, I continue doing that for a whole day. 

Although it's opposite to my rationality and discipline, I also realize and confirm one thing: I like designing and coding cool staff. 

I'm happy with this confirmation. It erases the fear and doubt about being an indie hacker as my next strategic step. It's not only a way of making a fortune, but more importantly, it's also one thing I would love to do, and a kind of lifestyle I would like to live in.

So I spare another day to make the blog much more fulfill my appetite, hoping it can be a place for long term writing. 

Here it is: https://liwuqiong.com/blog_zh, listed as the first [project](../_pages/projects.md_) in the content creation area. 

And I told myself: just this one last time. No more addicted to playing these tools staff. Get rid of shiny object syndrome. 

OK. Let's rock!
