This weekend I learnt how to use docsify, a light and simple opensource tool for making and managing online wiki and documents. Quite esay that only took less than 10 minitues to build and deploy. And another about 30 minitues to add more basic features like nav, sidebar and other staff. 

But the bad thing is that after the basic cofig, I spent hours doing useless things. Changing theme setup over and over again, try this and that and see the effect. And many plug-ins with various tiny functions. 

Shiny object syndrome. Fuck!
