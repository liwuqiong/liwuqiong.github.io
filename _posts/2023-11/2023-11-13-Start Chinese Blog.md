title: Start Chinese Blog

I decide to step forward on my content creation(i.e. project A3).

No more planning from the top. Just start from the ground. 

Daily blog is the very start. I document my progress and thoughts in detail. And it's on the domain liwuqiong.com.

Based on this site, I would like to add a feature listing the projects I'm doing. It's a show work to others and a focus reminder to myself as well.

The first project goes to the article writing in Chinese, a content creation project. It may include both tiny blog and long article writing. I have the desire to write some interesting staff to document my life and some elegant articles to express and share my thoughts.

Chinese is my mother language. I keep the habit of writing Chinese to sharpen my thoughts. And there are also complicated topics that using Chinese might be more efficient. Meanwhile I would like to reach to the Chinese audience. 

I have a WeChat Public Account(a Chinese mobile-based blog service hosted and provided by Tencent) to do the same thing. But to me it's just another channel, not a real host. I have no control and no copy of my work. There are so many hidden audit regulations on the platform. You don't know why your articles could not be published or be banned after publication. It's just what the environment is like. 

To be a bilingual writer, I keep learning and using English, hoping to enhance it to a level near mother tongue. 

And Chinese site is to start. 

It's on the sub-domain liwuqiong.com/zh. Maybe temporarily.
