I wrote a post [be humble](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/11/07/be-humble) several days ago. I would like to emphasis this character again.

Being humble means paying less attention to dignity. It's meaningless to care about what image you have in others' eyes. But what you know and learn matters. 

My goal is to make things accomplished and make myself stronger alongside. Always be humble to what I don't know is a wise policy. 

It also means being flexible about the route the result. Don't be stubborn.

Always be like a student. Find the shiny part from others, and learn from them.
