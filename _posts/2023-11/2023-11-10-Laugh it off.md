Having a little problem with a teammate in communication. We see things from different angles. And the way he talks to others made me unhappy. 

I should be more generous than I used to be. Don't pay much attention to the way people treat myself. The only focus is to make things work. To make my goal achieved. 
I can become much more patient along the way.

So don't give a shit to those odds and ends. 

Just laugh it off.
