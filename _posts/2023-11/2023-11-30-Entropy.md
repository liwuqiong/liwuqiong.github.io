Tuesday and Wednesday wasn't good. I went back to sleep late and the productivity in the day was like a dog. Bad mood either, with no willingness to do anything. Sleep more than 2 hours in the afternoon.  Swimming class canceled. 

So terrible. Such a mess.

Fighting against entropy is the ultimate meaning of life. I agree with that.

Stop here.
