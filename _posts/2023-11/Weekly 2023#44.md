This week is the first week after I quit my job and start a new journey of doing my own projects.

Project A1 runs on the rails. Metrics library is established through API request, about 50% progress. And UI of our product is upgraded. 

There are also many annoying problems, most of which come from the status quo that we are working remotely, and some staffs are part-time. The cost of communication is high. 

A pain period at the beginning. 

Project A2 is much slower than expected. I'm neary 60% in the progress of learning python course, camparing to the goal of this week is that completing the course. 

The main reason is that I was attacked by the "shiny object syndrome". I turn to another book by the wish of eccelerating the schedule. However, the result was opposite. And the exercises that were supposed to be done left undone. So I could say that the foundation was not sound. 

Next week, I must insist on the main course, distrill the most of it by watching most of the videos and doing most of the excises. And the knowledge management process should be accompanied to retain what I have got. Then I can press the pause button to look if there is another good learning resource as the next step.
