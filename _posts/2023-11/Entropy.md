Tuesday and Wednesday wasn't good. I went back to sleep late and the productivity in the day was like a dog. Not good mood either, with low willingness to do something. Sleep more than 2 hours in the afternoon. Canceled the swimming class. 

So terrible. Such a mess.

Fighting against entropy is the ultimate meaning of life. I agree with that.

Stop here.
