Learning programming python the whole day, covering the topic about functions, modules and http requests. I don't think it's productive. I could have done more, including some works on A1 and A3 project. 

The feeling of losing balance is bad. Time should be spent properly according to the todo list and adjusted quickly. 

Do the right thing first is always the hard part.
