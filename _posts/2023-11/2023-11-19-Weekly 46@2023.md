This week I mainly do one thing: [Start Chinese Blog](../2023/11/13/start-chinese-blog) as my first [project in Content Creation](../projects). Time spent are much more than expected, from 1 day to 3 days.

I've built it to meet my standard at my best. And also I decide not to let the perfectionism take over again. 

Set the scope and limit, and accept the satisfactory result. 

Next week, I would like to achieve several main things:
- Sustain the healthy habits, especially sleeping and exercising.
- Finish the metrics warehouse and charts building.
- Make a daily routine of writing 1.5 hours, including about 0.5 hour in publishing. 
- Finish the learning of Python, including the exercises attach to the course.
- Start the learning of opening store on the Amazon as the project A4.
