In the post [Content creation at large scale
](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/11/27/content-creation-at-large-scale), I've listed several lists to boost the volume of writing. Now I decided to start the list: Book Reading Comment. 

I could go to the library, grab a good book, read it and write what I thought quickly. The process is just for a glance of the book. So I won't spend much time(more than 2 hour) on one book. The best ones would be selected for further reading. 

The point is just read and write down. No bullshit, just like go to exercise when the clock comes.
