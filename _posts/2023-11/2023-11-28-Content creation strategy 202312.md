After several days' writing, my strategy on content creation is clearer. 

First, I am going to write dozens of articles in selected [serious](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/11/27/content-creation-at-large-scale) to fulfill the sites: [blog_zh](https://liwuqiong.com/blog_zh) and SocraData(https://socradata.com). 

**The writing task: 100 articles**
- blog_zh:
	- comment on book reading: 20 articles;
	- thought essay: 20 articles;
	- Others: 20 articles;
- SocraData: 
	- GPT/AI basics(learning notes): 20 articles;
	- Python learning notes: 20 articles;

Second, these articles would be revised and exported to several publishing sites:
- Daily routine(Writing&sharing):  
	- xiaohongshu app: focus on growth and thoughts
	- zhihu.com: focus on growth
	- twitter: focus on working progress 
	- weibo: focus on thoughts
	- toutiaohao: focus on news and knowledge
- Articles: 
	- WeChat public account

Publishing online is quite different from writing just on my own. I should take what the audiences like into consideration, and also learn the platforms' traffic mechanism.
