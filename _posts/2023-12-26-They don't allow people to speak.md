I'm so disappointed about the political environment in China. You can say nothing about anything, even the most common fact or history, if it has a just little relationship with what the Party doesn't think you should think or know. 

The magazine Caixin.com published an editorial article that recalling the history of China's reform based on respecting the truth. And just one day the article was banned to 404. 

I gave a comment less than 100 words in my weibo(China's twitter). And it went popular with many people reading, retweeting, and commenting. I can see that people have same feeling with me. 

And again, the post hadn't survived more than one day, it was deleted by the platform.  I'm not an influencer, with just 300 followers. The comment just expressed some disappointment. 

Even so, they don't allow you to speak.

I don't know what and why they fear. 

Disgusted.
