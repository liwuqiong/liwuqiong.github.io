My swimming learning has come to the 4th class. In the beginning there are 3 equipments to facilitate the process. Now there's only one left. Nice progress. 

However, there's still no progress in my Python learning in the whole December. As a matter of fact, it's totally suspended, meaning that the time I've put in it is zero. 

So is the learning in writing.

The main reason is that the time and energy management is too bad. Too much time is wasted in various kinds. For example, I may sleep at noon till 3 p.m. Just like a catastrophe. 

I must relaunch these projects as soon as possible from this week.
