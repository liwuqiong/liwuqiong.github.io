Without computer, it seems that I can hardly do anything. 

Several days ago I bring the Macbook to the Genius bar and the staff tells me they can do nothing about water inflow occasion. They suggest just dry it for three days and see whether it can restart. Otherwise the machine is damaged badly. The fix cost is high and even close to a brand new one. 

Three days pass by. I open it with a tiny hope of everything is fine. No miracle happens. 

Upset.
