In order to make it more clear and organized about what the *[true work]()* that I should do, I would like make an statement by using the clause"if I'm in the role of... then I do...", just like what [Mintzberg](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Henry_Mintzberg) discovered in his famous [Manager's Role Theory](https://www.mindtools.com/ajfb1ev/mintzbergs-management-roles). (Mintzberg is one of my favorite management scholars, here is his [other insightful theories](https://mintzberg.org/)). 

When in work, I have mainly three roles. What I'm supposed to do with each role are: 

**Role \#1: Entrepreneur
- **Idea**: Search for and test new ideas and opportunities
- **Design**: Design products and business logic
- **Communicate**: Talk/connect with people to learn, hire, sustain customer relationship and make network
- **Execute**: Execute the project quickly by pushing others and by myself
- **Channel**: Build the channel that matches products to achieve selling at scale

## Role \#2: Indie hacker
It's a sub-role of \#1 Entrepreneur as being a solo developer. So it covers all the above work, and also includes the specific:
- Writing code
- Connecting to audiences

**Role \#3: Writer
- Large amount of input of content
- Write dFown at a regular productive pace
- Edit and publish 

**Role \#4: Researcher**
- Reading papers
- Construction of theory
- Writing papers

**Some basic work
- Learn to know more about what you do(industry, product, benchmark, customer, yourself) by investigating, reading, talking, experiencing and retrospecting.
- Healthy lifestyle and habits to maintain peaceful mind and energetic status.
