I solve the problem of image uploading configuration using a cloud storage service. Again this time that many little problems along the way. 

I realize that problems are impossible to be solved all at once, just like things can't be done all.  It emerges one by one. As long as you want and do something, it is just there to be found. 

So I stop here. 

As to the left unsolved small problems or bugs, just leave them alone and let them go. 

Do the content creating work.
