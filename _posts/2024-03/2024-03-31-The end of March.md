It's the end of winter and the beginning of spring. It seems that I've done much, but nothing much to say when doing summary of it. What a joke!

But indeed, I have done something anyway. Some important features have been added to our product. The projects of A2 and A3 relaunch. 

And most importantly, I feel the momentum is being created and the progress is really happening. 

At a word, I feel good.

Keep the pace, just move on.

I look forward to the beautiful April.
