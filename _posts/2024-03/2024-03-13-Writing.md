For writing well, I do four tasks: 
1. Routine writing: writing at least 2000 words and refine&publish 3 articles one week.
2. Reading at a large scale: read high quality masterpiece. 
3. Writing skill learning
4. Writing practice: write a book or novel as a beginning

From yesterday on, I start to read *The Red and the Black*, a french novel written by Stendhal. A good one.

p.s. many work restart successfully. next is body exercise.
