This the 12rd week of 2024, indicating that one quarter of the year has been passed by. I feel a little nervous about the speed, and also wonder that what do I have done and achieved?

Today I go to the Olympic Park to have a walk. After that I go to new library that has been built just a few months ago. 

I have also made a plan aiming to take care of my health. I decide to take the problem of moderate fatty liver seriously. Although it may have nothing real as a result, there has already been some symptoms. And it shows in the medical examination report each year. 

I was always careless about things related to body and health. It's time to end this attitude. It's not only about the health thing, but also that my whole life quality. 

It's just like a process of sculpture. I'm the sculptor of my own life.
