I've updated the framework of self management according the new fact and recognition of my work and life. 

I believe it will leverage the efficiency much more. 

I also read a great book about self management today: Self-theories from Carl Dweck, a set of essays in social psychology. I get to know what holds me back in the past for a long time.

I believe both of the above will help produce a lasting momentum a lot. 

Let's see.
