I've read some stories of indie hacker. Each has his or her own growing line. But there is a common: they all persist till the end, no matter how hard it is or anything hinders them on the way.

If there is a trick to success, that's it. Don't expect the journey to be comfortable. That's not the truth. It must be so much pain out there. 

Just enjoy it. That's the meaning of being on the way.
