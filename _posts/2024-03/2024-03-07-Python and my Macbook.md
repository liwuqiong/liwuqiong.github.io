I restart the learning of Python today. The secret of action is no intervention of thought when the to-do list says what you should do next. 

Thought is necessary when in planning, but a burden when in action. 

Another thing... my MacBook was repaired a month ago, but left a small but annoying problem. Everything's fine when start the laptop, but when you close it(not shutdown) and reopen, which is a frequent action, the keyboard or touchpad doesn't work. Nothing could be input so as to operate the machine. So the only thing I can do is just shutdown the laptop every time when don't use it and power on the machine again and again in one day.

I send it to repairer, hoping it would be fixed.
