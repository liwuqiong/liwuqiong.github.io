My work in my startup is mainly about designing. Designing what? Product, a AI-based business intelligence product.

Another whole day of designing, from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. after midnight. It includes research of other related products, thinking of business logics and making sense of each function and experience. 

I feel myself like a God in the whelm of my product world, because it's me that decides how the users' needs to be satisfied. 

Meanwhile, I feel myself like a slave. As a matter of fact, I don't have the real power to decide the strategy and orientation of the product and the company. 

A paradox.
