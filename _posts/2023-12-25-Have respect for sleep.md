I should and must have respect for sleep, just like John Nash's having respect for beer in Princeton's library. 

Sleep early, get up early and have a good sleep... is the first step to a productive and successful day. 

At night my willpower goes down, and always forget to go to bed at time. The result is that in the next day I would be low energetic. Things won't work that way. 

Have respect for sleep!!!
