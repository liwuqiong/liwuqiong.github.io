# Plan for today and next few months_09/10/2023

Cut the crap. Time is limited and precious.

Today(2023/09/10) :

- Come up with the V1.0 product proposal and discuss it with my co-founder. ## A1
- Continue the research of SaaS software prerequisites, and expand the research of successful cases. Make a conclusion and decision. ##A2
- Write some new articles updating to my WeChat public account(a Tencent blogging platform).
- Write weekly report of work at noon. ##others
- [Memo] More and more articles waiting to be read. It might be a good idea to scatter them among Pomodoro intervals, instead of using large time blocks, which should be utilized for creating things.

- Push project #A1 to milestone of v1.0 launch and GTM successfully with at least 20 seed customers.
- Launch my own business.

    2) at least 3 articles for WeChat public account, including 1 for professional issue.
    3) Random: contribute an answer to zhihu.com or quota.com; Weibo.com.
