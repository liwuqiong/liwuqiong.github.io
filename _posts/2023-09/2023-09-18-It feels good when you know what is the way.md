# It feels good when you know what is the way

A new week. As I said several days ago in the post "Bomb!Milestone", I start a new period from this week.

I accelerate the pace of my projects, and invest more time in it. I have no time to waste.

So let's rock. And I feel good when I'm on a condition of kowing what is the way and what is the destination.

That's what a work should be like.
