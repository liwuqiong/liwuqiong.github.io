I have been working for ten years in several large internet companies, witnessing so many kinds of projects up and down. 

> To B or To C, internal or for market, supply or consume, user acquisition or revenue generation, advertising or natural traffic, marketing or technology, big data product/platform or backend/frontend function product, BI analysis or sales promotion...

The list could go on, but what I want to say is that those are not my projects intrinsically, whether you are an "owner" or not.

That's the fact in the so called large company, charging you the responsibility of doing one whole thing, but actually with little/no control of many aspects related.

It doesn't mean you have no influence or should not find a way to make things work. 

It means that everyone is just playing their role at last. For one who wants to reach an outstanding result, his/her attention and effort should lead to some other issues, frustrating and exhausting one's energy throughout the years.

You may not see the whole picture even if you get the ladder up to a high level. And above that goes in the intense political battle field.

So I think it comes to a time for me to do my own projects.  

It may start from a tiny one, or may be small, or without revenue.

But I believe this is the right thing at a right time. 

And it's always worthwhile to do the right and hard thing.

Certaintly I'll do this.
