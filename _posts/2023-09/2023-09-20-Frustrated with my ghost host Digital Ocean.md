# Frustrated with my ghost host Digital Ocean

I built this website on the host Digital Ocean about three weeks ago. I admit that the UI is great. However, the stability is week. Almost each day there would be several hours during which the website can't be opened, showing time-over.

And each time I spent much time investigating the reason and tried many methods, including emailing to the official support team several times, the staff were polite and offered some explanations and possible solutions, but nothing worked.

I have to wait, till the high CPU occupation lowers down itself after a few hours.

It's maybe that I have little knowledge about the server and Linux.

But I'm really frustrated about this experience.

It seems that the ram(right now plan is 1G) is not enough so the virtual memory uses too much CPU. A solution is to upgrade to a plan with more capacity of ram.

But I establish just ONE blog, and I am informed that 1G memory is enough for that.

I'm considering to switch to other host.
