# Learning from the past is the best lesson and asset

Today is satuday. I drive to a tourist attraction with my family nearly whole day. In the morning before starting, I call my co-founder for some unsettled topics. I come back home after 18 p.m. and get exhausted.

In the evening my energy is low and can't concentrate on doing or learning something, even if I take some lifting actions like take a warm shower, take a walk outside, play computer game, or just sit on the sofa for nothing .

So I know that actually I need to have a rest to recover and refresh. I decided to go to sleep before 22:30, which is the earliest go-to-bed hour in the past 5 years, maybe.

Now is about 21:50. There is some time left before goting to bed. So let's share a thought come up just now.

These days I'm considering starting my own business. Starting this journey there is a work that has to be done: to retrospect the past working years and distill the learning and know-how from that experience. This is one of my precious asset I have when I start a new period. It not only provides me with money, but the lessons of success and failure.

This would be one topic of this blog in the next few months. To make the most use of the past, is the true learning I think.
