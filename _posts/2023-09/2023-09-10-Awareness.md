# Awareness

In the self productivity realm, awareness is the first prerequisite. That means, you should keep conscious about who you are, what you are doing and what you are supposed to do.

Each time I end the day with low productivity, I recall what happened.

It always comes to mindless and useless action, such as swiping the phone, or reading too much materials trying to solve trival problems.

That is where awareness should've involved in.

Especially in the micro lens, you must keep in mind constantly that what is the most important goal and how much time you have at hand, so as to utilize the resource more wisely.

That's the key and the most challenging part to productivity.

I must be good at it.
