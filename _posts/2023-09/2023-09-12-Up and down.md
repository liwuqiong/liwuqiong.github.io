# Up and down

After my day work, I continue my investigation about indie hacker. What I got was almost all good things the other day. And this time I get something not that beautiful finally. I read an article written by a female indie hacker saying that she has been on this journey for 5 years after quiting job, and till now the MRR comes to $1K. In a hacker news post she reveals that she has other part-time job to earn extra money, and her parter(or maybe boyfriend/husband?) has a well paying job to cover the rest.

Thanks to this hacker's genuine sharing of her true story.

To be honest, I am kind of disappointed a bit. My illusion of indie hacker earning big money collapses. And I don't have the condition allowing me to chase what I want to do without having a steady income job.

Yes, the tide of sentiment and passion down, and the voice of rationality up in head.

It's not that bad, basically. Each industry has its multiple facets. It's just that I have got to know more about it and start to see the whole and real picture. It proves that my investigation is effective, and I am not a novice any more. Risk is everywhere, especially in such a non-stream and new track.

What I should do is learning from previous lessons, successful and not that successful. Focus on my instinct desire, and try to do my best.

Set the goal and stop loss line to cope with risk.

My plan is to learn and do my own projects as a side form in the previous, and all in it at a proper time(maybe the end of this year or later). Till the end of 2024, the expected milestone number would be MMR $5K.

I would add more detail to the plan.

Right now it's 23:30, I must go to sleep, for I want to getup early as a habit. Utilizing morning hours to do more on my projects. Self-motivated to do this for more than 2 months, is one of a signal to all in.

At least, it proves that I am not just saying or on impulse as before.

It verifies I truly love it.
