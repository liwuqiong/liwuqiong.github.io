# Prerequisites for starting my own projects full time

Get up at 8 a.m, it sucks. It must be that I go to bed at 23:30 and swipe the iPhone for about 20 minutes.

That is the difficult part: sleep early, without any additional actions. Take a shower, go to bed, fall asleep, that's it. No cellphone, no thinking, no watching or reading.

And from systematic view, I should be high productive and effective in the day so as to be satisfied and confident about the work. The  dragging before sleep are basically related to the dissatisfaction about daily work, like trying to echoing: don't! do something more! But actually just make things worse.

So it goes to focus on the basics:

- Be well planned in the day, with clear goal;
- Be determined and motivated when in bad status.

It seems that I am still not well prepared about my projects. I don't mean perfectionism, without any risk. I am saying the underline, that you can't quit just by an impulse, with no basic status and solid work. That will lead you to a bad condition, which is dangerous.



In order to ease and peace my conflicting mind, I figure out and set the prerequisites for starting my own projects full time:

- Status: Proactively disciplined to form healthy habits every day, thus naturally focus on the most important things. **Indicator: sleep early and do some exercise everyday.**
- SJ project: product V1.0 online and get 20 customers. Get angel investment would be better.
- Generator Project: start a business leanly in one month, from opportunity seizing, demand insight,  product design, developing and distribution channel, using no-code tech to accelerate the pace.
- Content Creating:  writing and publishing articles to various platforms frequently. **Indicator: followers grow continuously**.

Just one of the above prerequisites comes is done, the time is matured.

Deadline: Dec, 2023.



That's it. Don't think too much anymore. Just do it. 

Wish me good luck.
