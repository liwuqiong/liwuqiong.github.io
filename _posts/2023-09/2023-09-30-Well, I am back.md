# Well, I am back

Sorry about the 10 day's break. One of the reasons is that I get frustrated about Digital Ocean host. The website can't be opened frequently because of high cpu usage. Having tried so many methods and spent much time, my patience is exhausted. Maybe the only way is to pay more money to upgrade to a more premium plan.

I can't stand the website stays 502 for more than several days. Nightmare.

And I want to switch to WordPress for its fast and stable character.

During I am thinking of the above, a week passed by without a post published. I tried two other host for ghost, one is AWS.  And I also turned off the droplet and turned on it again after several hours.

And when I see the 10 days' blank I realize that I make a common mistake again. I lose my fucking focus. I am distracted by things not important at all, not now at least. Much time was spent and nothing was written.

So here it is. I am back. Continue to write my daily blog.

Forget about the fucking website configuring thing.

For a just-one-month old website with less than 5 view per day, caring about the stable thing is ridiculous.

When the affair happens again, just let it go. Don't give it a shit.

Focus on the important part: don't stop writing. If the online ghost doesn't work, just write it on twitter, mac note, or whatever place.
