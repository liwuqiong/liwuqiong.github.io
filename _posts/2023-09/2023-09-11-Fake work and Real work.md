# Fake work and Real work

Donald Trump is famous for his pet phrase "Fake News". It reminds people be careful about the existence of a certain kind of news. Open your eye and think before believing in what you see and hear rushingly.

Working has the same scenario.

This weekend I haven't finished [what I've planned to do](https://liwuqiong.com/todays-plan/). Not due to time limit. I spent more than 3 hours doing some trivial things fiddling with the Ghost theme configure.

How to change font? How to change font size? How to display more than 5 post in home page? etc.

And my droplet on digital ocean seems unstable. Sometimes it runs time out. So I searching tons of information trying to solve it.



The work above are just *FAKE work*.

Fake work is attractive but dangerous. It's easy to be indulged in,  forging an illusion that  you are working hard and making a progress.

Bullshit. Actually it's no different with swiping smartphone on Ticktok.

What I should do? Just let it go.

When the intention arises, hold on, ignore it. Don't give it a fuck.

Stick to your goal and plan.

Put the focus on the *REAL work*.
