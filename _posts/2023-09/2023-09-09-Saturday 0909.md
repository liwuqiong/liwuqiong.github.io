Wake up at 6 a.m., work about 2 hours, and then drive to city with my family, spending whole day in a large shopping center with IKEA. Back home at nearly 10 p.m.

During the day I continued to research indie hacker's cases and learn more about SaaS software development basics.

Key takeaways:

- One must clarify his mind frequently by means like blogging(any other methods are fine, if only it is suitable for you). It's an endeavor to fight against entropy. So discipline and habit are important tools.
- Along the way of doing your own project(a period before starting your own business) there must be up and down and full of various kinds of problems, tiny or large, annoying or disgusting. Some may even beat you down. But remember, it's just the way which you choose be like. Be calm about what -happens, and be patient about what is expected to happen. Just keep going to the final destination.
- Step: 1)Define niche market and understand the demand deeply. 2) Come up with an idea and verify it quickly. 3)Build a product or solution. 4) Sell it.



I tweeted in the morning with two decisions I've made:

- Abandon alcohol
- Go on a diet

I believe by doing these I would be much healthier and more productive.



Besides, I am forming a habit about sleep: go to bed early and get up early.

I have been used to sleep after midnight for the past 5 years. The bad habit damages my body health and working status quite much.

To make a new me, this habit is the first to crash and build a new one.



BTW, it rained the whole day.

Autumn is coming. My favorite season.
