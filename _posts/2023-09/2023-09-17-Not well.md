# Not well...

Today is not very well. Although sleep early last night and get up early this morning, still sleepy in the day. You know what? I take a little nap at 10 o'clock and 16 o'clock while working.

And my stomach is not well either. I go to toilet twice, one in the morning, the other in the afternoon.

So it's an unproductive day, ending with just read some articles and doing a little design work.

It's necessary to take more exercise to make my body much more robust.
