# A research before coming up with an idea

The first step is to come up with a feasible idea to start my own project.

And to do that, I have to conduct a small research of some successful cases, especially those attract my attention these days.

Today's list includes:

1. getcyberleads.com
2. URL scanning service
3. Paper website
4. Paperform.com

These products and business model impress me, and I have to learn how they get there.

For example, the getcyberleads.com was what I spent much time on today, and I thought the developer had got the secret of starting a business after 19 failures. And I was a little "envy" about his small age at which he had reached to such a thorough recognition.

During the research, I have also encountered some related products or services, which might help me do my own projects in the future:

- appsum
- hubsopt
- lemlist
- hunter.io
- airtable.com
- subreddit
- indiehackers.com
- startups.com
- devcake.se
- stackshare.io
- carrd.co
- link stripe
- typeform
- angellist
- crunchbase
- wix

I would add more detail information later on.

See you tomorrow!
