# No one cares about you

Anyone who wants to be somebody and make a difference, must remember that no one cares about you. So he/she can do things without much worries or paying too much attention to others' comments.

I totally agree with that, and this is what I learnt in my career these several years. Don't let others' opinion influence you a lot, and don't feel shy for doing something public or guilty for making a fault.

Basically, no one cares about you. Any impression about others is illusion in your mind, which is totally unnecessary.

Just be yourself. Be bold to go my own way.
