# I think I am a creator

I've read a lot articles about SaaS software development these at weekend. Refresh and solidify my previous knowledge on this issue.

For example, the concept of SaaS has two facets: one is about delivery mode from one-time to subscription, the other is about the developing infrastructure lies in Cloud.

And the usual stack in frontend and backend, the cost structure and the whole process of a SaaS project.



There was a moment when I thought I found my role in this world. With what I have been and done for the past 10 years, I become more convinced.

That I am a c*reator*.

Creating things with idea verification, proactively polishing the work, and selling it to finish the circle.

It has some branches:

- Developer(indie hacker): Creating for digital product/service.
- Writer: Creating for words and thoughts.
- Researcher: Creating for insights and theory.



I'm good at doing it.

I take all control of my time. None orders me what to do and what not to do.

And the most important part: I am excited and *happy* doing it.

That's where I accomplish great work.

That's my life.
