Considering to quit my comfortable, decent and well-paying job

I have to admit the truth that my job is quite comfortable: working intensity and load is low, high profile, high degree of freedom, and payment is impressive.

A typical day: driving to workplace and parking on my space. Go upstairs at about 10 a.m., and start doing today's work unhurriedly. Then drive home at about 7 p.m. if I want, while many others have to stay till after 9 or 10 p.m.  

Almost forgot to mention, generally there are have about 2 hours for lunch and break. I often go to my car to take a nap.

But I am still considering a quit, repeatedly, in this half year.

It seems that I am an idiot, especially in such a time when china's economy goes down rapidly, the atmosphere lacking of confidence.

So many get laid off, including high level senior managers with abundant experience.

But I know clearly what I am doing.

First of all, I must take control of my work and life, just like one need breath.

I have been hanging out mindlessly for more than ten years, taking a route others have arranged well previously.

But if you ask are you regretful about that? My answer is no.

Yes, in the retrospective of success, I did miss many big opportunities and waste much time. If not, I could have been much more successful and wealthy than now.

However the past years give me an opportunity to experience a life of  simple happiness, and having that I am grateful.

And I can't blame one's growing path and cognitive awakening to be a fixed pattern. Everyone has his/her own time.

My case is that I start to realize what I truly want and whom I truly want to be after my 30.

I was haunted by questions like these for weeks:

> Is it too late to start my own business?

> Is the risk too high from quitting a decent and well-paying job to a status without stable income?

> Is the idea just a sudden impulse without deep consideration or without a verification of you are truly loving and good at what you want to do?

The list could go on, meaning that I have thought almost every respect and scenario related to this decision.



And now I don't hesitate anymore. I will write the consideration process in another article.

But the final conclusion comes: YES, I will quit my job.

The only question is timing: whether right now or get this done till the end of this year.
