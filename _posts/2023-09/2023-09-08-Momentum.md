Momentum is quite important, transmitting continuously a signal that you are on the right track and gaining confidence about the future success to come.

My bad habit is playing pc game at weekend till midnight, and then the next several days would be low productive because of the sleepy and tired status, just like being fucked by a dog.

And I have to use extra days and hours to restart.

100% a killer to the momentum. What a f××k.

I played games as usual this Friday, and after 2 hours I suddenly thought of the momentum thing.

So I stopped immediately and go back to what I am supposed to do.

I make a promise to myself: this week would be a productive one.

And keep reminding myself of the changing situation:

I am no longer that comfortable employee.

**I am a creator, learning to be a developer and a fucking entrepreneur.**
