# Execution

In a startup, idea is important. But execution weighs much more, especially in a rapid changing industry.

When we talk about the ability of execution, we are mainly refering to the speed. Action fast, to accomplish the key results before others, and at a agile tempo.

And when we talk about moving fast, we are mainly refering to being focused. Focus on the key result, and don't let some less important things intervene the execution route. It needs the awareness to keep in mind the most important thing and also the willpower to stick to it.

My execution ability is not good. Frequently I'm distracted to other issue and forget the main goal. Much time and effort is wasted. A shame.
