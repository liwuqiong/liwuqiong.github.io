# Launch the my first content project(A3.2)

Restart a WeChat public account that has been unused for about 2 years.

Redesign the position, name and logo.

I want to share my information and knowledge creation and process with those who are eager in information of high quality but have no access or don't know how to manage info to create knowledge.

The demand exists.

But the idea may have no much potential to monetize. And in this market there are too many supply, which means you may not get much traffic, and the copy risk is high.

So I position this project mainly to be an output mechanism to force myself managing information and knowledge efficiently. Secondly, it must be helpful to others in need, if I indeed do an outstanding job.

The different part that makes me survive and succeed may be two things:

1. I do it manually,  information source, digest, editing, insight mining(may have) is all by human, no robots. It may be related to personal subjective view, but it is unique, and an assurance of high quality.
2. Persistence. I am not a media institution. All I have is my time, only small part to this project. I have investigated this kind of accounts, and most of them exist a short time, publishing several days or weeks and then stop updating. I used to be like that. This time, I regard it as a non-profit business at the start. Non-profit business is still a business, which means I must take it seriously, and can't give up casually.

Besides, I set a bottom line also. If the traffic is too low after all the attempts, I would consider it to decrease update frequency and might be off publishing, which means turns into my internal thing.

I assign the project code A3.2, and the account name is "信息差使君".

Meaning a messenger to deliver information to eliminate the information gap, which is a hot word in Chinese community nowadays.

So the English name is MindGapBridge. (for the function is just like a bridge linking unknown to known and insight.)

See you tomorrow!
