# I make a Plan for content creation

Eat too much at lunch. So I go downstairs for a walk.

And I organize the thoughts these days about my writing project, i.e. creating content constantly and part of it would grow up to a business.

## 1_documenting myself daily

Daily blog about my working progress, as well as stories on learning and life. Freely and constantly. Just like what I do here, it helps to organize my thoughts.

*Randomly. Non business.*

## 2_My personal thoughts expression

Essay about specific topics, review on some books/movies, or any other kind of article with a complete structure.

- Mainly in WeChat public account: 忽南忽北。
- Answer questions on zhihu.com, quora.com

*Randomly. Non business.*

## 3_Information and knowledge sharing

To stay in touch with the world, I collect and absorb information(mainly on data and tech area) nearly everyday. It may be a good idea to share my digestion and professional comments with those in need.

- WeChat public account: 消灭信息差使君
- WeChat public account: 数字化运营
- Socradata.com

*Designed. Maybe a media in the future, if successful.*

## 4_notes on financial freedom

I am careless and indifferent on money things. Partly because of my character or mindset, and partly because of my job has always paid me well.

But those are all gone with the wind. I have to pay more attention to the finance part of my life. It's another key resource to my dream, and a quantifiable goal indicator to the success of my projects.

So why not find a niche related to this facet of me, and share with people alike?

And I want to make set the tone from start: genuine and cool.

- Toutiao account
- website(TBD)

*Designed. Maybe became a KOL in the future, if successful.*

All the above is a plan for testing. And I will see what to do next. Maybe the channel is not suitable, or only texts is go with graphs and videos(which i have no experience at all) , or my writing sucks, or the idea is bad from the start.

That's OK.

Just test, get the result, learn and adjust it, and restart again.

That's where progress comes in.
