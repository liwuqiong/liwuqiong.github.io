# Monday

I hate having to spend about 3 hours on communicating. Traffic jam are wasting my life, event if I try to make most use of it by reading ebooks or listening podcasts while driving.

Today I write some articles articulating my planning. I want to devote much more time on action.

Before going to bed, I come across some posts about going abroad for a degree. It makes me interested.
