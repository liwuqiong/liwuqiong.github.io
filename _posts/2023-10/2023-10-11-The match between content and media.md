When you are posting something to attract traffic, you have to keep in mind the match between your post and the media.

One of my tiny project(A3.1-3)  is on xiaohongshu.com(小红书), a popular platform to share knowledge and life.

I don't pay much attention on it, and the data is poor, unsurprisingly. After posting more than 20 notes, the follower is less than 10.

I am thinking to switch the mindset. No more just post some casual staff, but provide what the market like and need.

From my observation, the kind of post that condensing information to make a list or draw a concise and new angle conclusion, may be quite popular.

And it's also compatible  with what I do now. In order to retain the knowledge from various input channels, I am forging a habit to review, take notes and build a knowledge database.

Writing, sharing and teaching are the output to complete the circle. Xiaohongshu is one of that. So is this blog.

The above observation could be an assumption. I will test it as the next step action of project A3.1-3.
