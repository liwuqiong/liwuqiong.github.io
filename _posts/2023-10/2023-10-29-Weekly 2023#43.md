In this week our product has been pushed to version 0.6, and things are not fine. Many of our programmers don't devote much time into it because of part-time working status. So we discuss about it and come up with some ways to solve it, including cash incentives and more real-time communication. 

It seems that we have to endure the pain during such a special period.

Besides, we have settled the stock share issues among co-founders and some details related. Things start to get on track.

I finnaly quit my job this week. The last day was 10/27, friday. A milestone that should be remembered.

As for my indie hacker journey, I start to learn python after the learning of git&github in the previous week. 

Acctually, I have many periods of learning programming experiences scattered from primary school to the work after post-graduation. 

However, none of it ends up fully with a real acuquisation of one language. It's a reflection of my history of just starting without final endding. 

So this time, I decide to make a change. I believe to be a developer is a must for my goal. It's the way that suits me. And I can feel happiness from doing it. At the bottom, it's an echo for my so many times of previously unfinished endeavous, just like a regression model.
