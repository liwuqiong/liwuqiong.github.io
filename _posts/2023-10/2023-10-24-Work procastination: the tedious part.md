> Don't procastinate anything you should do, including what you don't want to do.

My A1 project does not have much progress. To be frank, there is some tedious work that I don't want to do. However, I must force myself to dive into it, instead of postponing it till the last minute. 

Damn! Getting on a startup is by no means doing whatever you want with no limits. Even in your favorite work there are some parts you feel sick to. 

That is what work really like, no matter what you do.
