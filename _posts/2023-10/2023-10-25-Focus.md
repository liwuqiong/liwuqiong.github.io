Focus

It seems that things get stuck again. Unproductive these days. 

I'm aware of the fact that I'm still not focused. Too randomly and distracted by other tedious things, sometimes as a way of escaping from the most important but also difficult part. 

My focus: 

1. push the product online ontime.
2. Indulge into learning courses to be a developer. 
3. large amount of imput to nourish writing output.

Throw all my mind onto these three things.
