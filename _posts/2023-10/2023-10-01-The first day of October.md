# The first day of October

10/1, the first day of october, less than 100 days of this year.

It's the National Day of China. And also a traditional long holiday.

I took my family to Tsingdao City for a vacation. I drove the whole day, from 10 a.m. to 23 p.m. when arriving at the hotel. So tired.

The city is famous for its beautiful scene. Hope a pleasant journey.
