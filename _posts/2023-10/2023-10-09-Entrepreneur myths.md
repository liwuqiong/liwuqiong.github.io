# Entrepreneur myths

Reading the book "Entrepreneur myths"  these day, of which the facts and advices about entre are fucking so good.

The author, Damir Perge, has funded more than 50million dollars to startups as an angel, and concluded 50 myths to destroy people's illusion about what entrepreneur should be like.

It helps me to make a real vision.

But basically, I have to dive in the pool to figure it out by myself.

With the guiding advice ahead in mind, I believe the odds would be a little higher.
