Nearly a week haven't been posted. One reason is that I finally decide to build my own site, after the patience exhausted. The ghost site hosted on digital ocean is still unbeared slow, especially that several times I have to wait minutes to login the backend when the desire to write needs to be seized at the moment.

I investigated and decided to turn to static and open-source solution. Among Jekyll, Hugo, Huxo, I choose Jekyll. No much specific reason. They have rare substantisl difference.

So here it is. You are surfing a site I have built manully for about 3 days, in which I come accross various kinds of error from terminal, and spend large amounts of time and effort to search and solve it one by one. 

Btw, I am not a tech developer(just tring to learn to be), and the process is full of setback when the error report appear one by one. Not a single step was s, I found that the time needed was much smaller than in reality. My time was spent mostly on the searching, trying  and researching, retrying... finally a snipped code worked, and moved on, to meet another same problem.

I would share the detail of it in the future to help others could save more time. 

But on the other side, I have found that I am kind of like programming and solving tech problems. During these days I have slept less than 5 hours on each, and always forget eat and rest. I sit in there concentrating on the issues about fixing this or adujsting that, and I'm not aware of time passing by so quickly. 

After completing the creation, I got addicted to picking and changing to a new theme. Find, download, apply, make tiny ajustments to make it look good... round and round, take another one day.

Dive into CLI(shell), ruby gem packages, git/github at first and then markdown, html, css.  

The whole experience these days is just like playing an overhelming and immersive online game. 

And at the end I am more confident that I could achieve the goal of becoming an indie hacker. 

No scare about the coding/programming: intimidating language, software, back-end server and the annoying recursive configuring and debugging process. In fact, I'm a little like the challenge.

Now I would like to say, OK, let's stop here. 

I should move on to the next step. 

A new start of my journey to become a writer(content creator) and developer.
