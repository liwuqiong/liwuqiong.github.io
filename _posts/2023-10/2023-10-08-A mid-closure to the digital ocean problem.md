# A mid-closure to the digital ocean problem

After trying many hosts, I say to myself: OK, I give in.

I go back to Digital Ocean, and pay more to upgrade the plan with more RAM. The former is $7/mo, the lowest. Now is $12/mo, nearly double. Actually what I get is RAM 1G goes to 2G.

I hope it will make everything fine. No more cases that the site can't open when I just want to write something.

And a pleasure part is that I make two adjustments that I want to do last month, by editing theme file. One is removing sign in button, and the other is load more than 5 posts.

It seems much better now. Maybe someday I would add the button back to retain some members.

Now let's restart writing again.

I tried more than 3 hosts today and come to a point nearly switch to PikaPod, a wonderful host with fast speed and low charge. Everything was fine. However  the DNS config was fuck, while I want to add the custom domain. After more than 2 hours searching and employing possible solutions but nothing worked, I gave up.
