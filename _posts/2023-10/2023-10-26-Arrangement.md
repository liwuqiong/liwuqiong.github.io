Project A1 is my main project.  

However, I won't devote too much time into it. Because I am one of the co-founders, not the big shot that has the full control and power. 

That's why I must do my own project to be a soloprenuer as an indie hacker, and start my own business to open an online store. 


I realize that my character and wish is to be fully control my work, especially with craft effort, and just a few core mates in it. 

I don't want to work with people I don't like. And no more fucking bull shit reports to this head or to that boss.

That's one reason I leave 10years of office-type work. 

Enough of it. Never go back to it again.

I wish I had realized that and turned to my own field earlier. 

Too much time wasted. 

No more regretful about the past and worried about the future. 

Just begin right now.
