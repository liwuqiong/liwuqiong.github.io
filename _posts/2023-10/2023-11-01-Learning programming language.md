Learning a new language is a kind of patience practicing, just like other skills. You are supposed to stay calm, patient, step by step. Don't hesitate. 

I get a little impatient. I want to speed up the pase, to go over the basics part quikly. I wan to get to the real project part to reverse the learning process. In doing practical project, the basics could be reviewed if not familiar. 

Just a good wish, but it hardly works.

So I go back to the model of lesson and exercise step by step. 

Gosh! Don't be too hurry. Just focus on the present, and time will tell a full story.
