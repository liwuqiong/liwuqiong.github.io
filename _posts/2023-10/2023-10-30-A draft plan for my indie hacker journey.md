First of all, I must get the basic programming skills that enable me to make an MVP. The stack includes python for backend, javascript, html, css for front end, and some basics on web development and database.

I plan to spend about 3 months to get the above skills.

Meanwhile, keep watching the real best practical cases to get familar with the market. And then come up with the ideas and test them. Engage in the community procatively. 

And from about 2024 january, I would be able to create some products based on the proven ideas. And also start throwing it into some channels. 

I hope to make the first revenue at the second half year in 2024.

Good luck!
