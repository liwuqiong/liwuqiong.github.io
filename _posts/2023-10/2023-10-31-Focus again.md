It seems that time and energy is never enough for the to-do list. It's used up so soon that can be hardly aware of. And the worse part is figuring out what has been done is not so much compared to the amount of time and energy spent. Fuck!

This week has been two days past by.  The above is what I feel at 23:40 right now.

So I know there must be something wrong on my usage arrangement of time and energy. 

Simply put, I think I haven't been focused enough. Focus on what's the most important and right. Focus on the thing itself so as to enter flow status. 

This F-word is what I should remember in the next few days. 

Focus.
