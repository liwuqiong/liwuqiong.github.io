Things seem to be out of control the other days. I have thrown too much time into unimportant things. Enerny exhausted, but low productive.

At least, the blog site comes to a final and stable point. No more big effort on the addjustments and decoration. 

Just writing. 

I must go back to a normal and healthy track.

First of all, emphasis on the habit of early sleeping again. In terms of energy management and personal health, I have the responsibility to keep myself in a basic nicely status, bothly in body and mood. Enough and regular sleep is crutial to it.

And then, settle a concise time usage framework aiming to prioritize kinds of ToDos quickly. The morning(8-12) mainly goes to A1 project. The Afternoon(14-17) mainly goes to A2 project. The night(19-21) mainly goes to A3&X project. The other time is to be arranged with flexibility. 

And a lesson I've got: no more attention and effort on the tiny staffs like tools, themes, color, placement, plug-in, short cut, tiny tricks... With no real staff produced, they are fucking useless. Shiny object syndrome is harmful, just like drugs, easily addicted to it. Alert on it!

With the actions above, I hope I could bring things back into control right now.

And this daily blog continues.
