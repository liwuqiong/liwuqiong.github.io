> A new journey begins. Fearlessly.

Quit my job today, a descision made [one month ago](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/09/14/bomb-milestone). And finnally the last day comes, I feel nothing much. Just go through the process. 

I had feeling about it two weeks ago. It was not good, though. The bad side of it started to create panic, when the time was nearly. But the conclusion was the same. So the panic just lasted a few hours. I convinced myself many times that this was a necessary step at the time. I bear the consequence, no matter what it goes to.

Yes, I end a journey of ten years. This journey is stable, decent, well-paying. And the interesting part, it is what the society, family and community regard as a NORMAL way of living. 

In China, having a steady job in famous company is normal. There is not much other options to be regared as normal. Diversification is rare. 

Fuck the so-called NORMAL. 

This time, I decide to go my own way. Shape my life to my own dreaming version. 

From today on, I am no longer a 10-10-5 worker that accustoms to the regulation and screwing work. 

I must learn to be an entreprenuer, and indie hacker, a writer and then to be a scholar, in a real world. 

It's a brand new journey. Time is priceless and I have wasted it much before. I must drop many bad habits and take things seriously. 

Let's go, fearlessly.
