It seems that I get into a trap in which I can't figure out what is really important and what to do. 

After all, I did nothing for indie hacker in the several weeks of May, except for that I've bought a book related to Python. 

I spent much time on my entrepreneur and writing work. Besides, I've started preparing for GMAT. That's maybe a reason why there is no time left for indie hacker. 

However, the work I spare time in doesn't make much progress either. The product is still not fine. I read a lot and write a lot, but still feel bad about my writing. And what's worse, I go back to the mode of sleeping late and the efficiency goes down in daytime, hence that the work seems never to be finished.

That's really bad. 

But I know that things are like this up and down. What I need to do is neglecting these several weeks. Face directly to the fact without fear and regret. Wake up the enthusiasm, focus on the current, tiny things and do it one by one.
