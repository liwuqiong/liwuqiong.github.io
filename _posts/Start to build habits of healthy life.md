I quit my job last month not only to start my own projects as a new entrepreneur journey, but also to build new habits to lead a healthy life. 

A healthy lifestyle is actually what I need at the foremost above all things. Yes, I say "above all things", meaning that more important than conducting projects. 

It's the basic foundation that influences all my work, study, body, relationship and personal and family life. 

I escape from the past time to end both the work mode in the office company and the life mode with no caring about real important things. It doesn't mean I'm not aware of the caring, but that I never succeed because of being in that work mode. 

Work and life are so highly related and connected that if one is in the bad status then the other would be sinking down and reversely affecting back. This imbalance leads to downward spiral where I hardly survive out. 

So I break up the chain by quitting one leading factor: Work mode. Now I've start my own projects both as entrepreneurial cofounder and content creator(in the future as indie hacker). I have nearly fully control of my time. 

Then I'm going to rebuild my lifestyle, to enhance the working efficiency and to lead a better and healthier life.
