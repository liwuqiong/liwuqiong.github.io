I want to find a way to create content at large scale. This way might be more of exercise intention instead of just intrinsic. There should be dozens of essays published at first to make a basic launch. And then it might be the time to write several articles with careful revision. 

The way is serious or vertical writing. I think it might work so I would like to test it.
