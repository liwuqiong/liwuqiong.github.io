My swimming learning has come to the 4th class. In the beginning there are 3 equipments to facilitate swim learning. Now it's only one. Feel good. 

There's no progress in my Python learning in the whole December. Actually, it's totally suspended, meaning that the time I've put in it is zero. 

So is the learning in writing.

The main reason is that the time and energy management is bad. Too much time is wasted in various kinds. For example, I may sleep at noon till 3 p.m. Just like a catastrophe. 

I must relaunch these projects as soon as possible from this week.
