I decided to [build healthy habits](https://liwuqiong.com/2023/11/16/start-to-build-habits-of-healthy-life) last week. The most important part is sleep and sport. 

I sleep before 23:30 each night, whereas it's about 1 a.m. previously in contrast. Make a small step to end the habit of staying up late. Good track! Move on. 

As for the sport, I decide to learn swimming as the first step. I never swim before ever. I just can't. 

I appoint a class in the swimming pool, and buy the equipment. In about 6 o'clock, I go to the pool and take my first swimming class in my whole life. 

I was falling into ice cold water in my childhood. That's why I don't go into water after so many years. The idea of learning swimming comes out many times, but always just remains in the head.

Several days ago I saw the swimming pool class, and asked for the detail. And today I just took in. No additional burden. 

Just start.
