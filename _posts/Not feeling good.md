I have to say that I don't feel comfortable in the project A1. This feeling occurs many times that I have to admit it. 

I think the reason is that I am not the guy who has the final decision. In some cases I have to do what others tell me to do, even when I don't agree with the proposal. I don't participate most of(if not each) critical meeting conversation. I am not the one who initiate the main launch. And I have to report the progress each week and every time when the boss asks. 

Besides, many decisions are lack of consideration in my opinion. But I don't have much speaking power, and my advices are not considered seriously. 

This makes me feel not so good. Just like another office work. 

It's not a place that suits my dream work.

Nevertheless,  I have to adjust my attitude. I should be grateful to what I have got. And be humble to learn things from others. Be like a student. And much more flexible. I'm here not for success. Instead, it's a learning practice. So I should pay more attention to what I can learn instead of what I can accomplish. And being liked by others is also important, if not for real care. So don't be too overwhelmed. 

And the other side implication for me is that I should be more wise on the arrangement among multiple projects. A1 is still the most important. But I must spare much more time on project A2, A3, A4 and X. These are my own projects truly and literally. In this sense, A1 project is like a shelter. And I should be thankful and grateful to this just in time opportunity where I am invited to participate in. No more other expectation. 

I hope the day when my own projects thrive to be independent and booming comes early. 

I will do my best.
