Sleeping late is like drinking alcohol: you may feel fantastic and painful mixed at that time, but left only painful in the next day.

And the worse is that the willingness to do things is exhausted. I have goal, plan, desire and time, but just do nothing. I can't fight back and push myself to act. 

I would not sleep late easily. Only for the most important thing may it be permitted, or there would no way to do this again.
