Today I rest at home. 

The spring comes. It's warm outside, and kinds of trees are blooming. 

I take a sleep. After that, I feel lack in the willingness to do anything. But I can't see time pass by like this. 

So I start to watch movie "Batman", the Dark Knight series, which I may have watched ten years ago but left little memory. 

The story is attractive and wonderful. And the meaning it conveys is encouraging and full of wisdom. 

April is beautiful every year. But it seems a little hard for me this year. Instead of a specific character, Batman is a symbol that has the willpower to beat his own fear and master himself.

I'm my own batman.
