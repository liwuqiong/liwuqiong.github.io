These days I've studied policies on immigrants to America. It's the first time I get to know those details, and it makes me a little tired. The policy is getting much more strict. Too much Chinese turn to this way out because of several reasons. 

Anyway, it's not a must for me. My biggest focus is still to make good products. But the topic of preparing for my next half life should be put onto the table. I must think about it as early as possible, especially that it seems that I'm already fall behind.
