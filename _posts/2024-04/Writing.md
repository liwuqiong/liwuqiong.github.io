I find myself still struggling in how to write better in Chinese. I've read a lot books related to how to write, and I'm sure that I'm on the track of being a good writer. 

But till now, I'm a little about the poor writing quality and speed. 

I set a task as the baseline: publish at least two well written articles on my own channel. 

Stay at it. Things would be fine. 

Besides, I read Schopenhauer's philosophy and autobiography of I. Asimov. A nice day.
