I've started preparing the GMAT exam at the end of April.

It's a long history talking about taking exam and going abroad. In 2008 I've started preparing GRE, and then decided to turn to domestic postgraduate. The idea of going abroad arose again in 2015, and prepared GMAT for about 1 month, then ended up with nothing. 

Now it's been 16 years after the first try. There are something in life that would always come up rotationally, if you don't give them a fucking end. 

For me, this is the thing. I must do it and give it an end.
