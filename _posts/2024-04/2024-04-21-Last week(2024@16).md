It's too busy last week that I didn't write a memo. Here is it. 

There is a progress in data quality enhancement and some new features added. 

I've read a lot on how to write a better essay. The principle of writing concisely attracts me. I have to practice more to make the knowledge become real.

I've also read something about applying for MBA degree. That would be another choice for my next step in my life and career. I take it seriously. I may start it with GMAT preparation and selecting the right school.

I think the life is mainly about choices. No matter in what occasion there would always be choice A or choice B, C etc... The difference is that whether you make the choice on your own heart or just by random. 

I will make my own choice.
