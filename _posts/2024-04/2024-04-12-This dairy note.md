I write this dairy note is for a memo of my work and learning, but also a discipline of my life.

In this sense, I should make this writing as the ceremony for the ending of one day, instead of a burden homework.

It's an opportunity for me to recap what I have done and learnt in this day. It maybe a little tough as recalling the whole day and trying to summarize the core info from it, but I have to and should be like to do it.

That's what I call a "discipline".
