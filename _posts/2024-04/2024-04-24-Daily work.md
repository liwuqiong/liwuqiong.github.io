Last night I had a discussion with two co-founders. The discussion went on for over three hours. We had met a problem and the consensus was hardly to be achieved. 

I slept till 2 a.m. and got up late to 9 a.m. this morning. So I worked at home. In the morning there would be a scheduled meeting. I had lots of words to say in order to push the progress move on.

From noon to afternoon, there were several bugs occurring and I had to communicate and try to solve them. Then I had an interview for recruiting a new intern. 

Work is just like these trifles above. I can't say I love it so much. That's not true. But I know it's what daily things are like. 

The future is based on the daily work. What I need to focus is the work that really matters and put it first to do.
