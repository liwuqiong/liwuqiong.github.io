A new start of indie hacker journey: web development. I use the web developer camp 2022  in Udemy. A wonderful course.

Besides, I get to know the Growth mindset recommended by Professor Carol Dweck. I am the one who used to be trapped in the fixed mindset. That's why I reach high in the first half and then fall down in the next one. Well, I mean, I was not THAT successful like several years before in other people's eye. I'm trying to learn the growth mindset, it teaches me a lot.

Just walk on. Let's see where it would lead me to.
