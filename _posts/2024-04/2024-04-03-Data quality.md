We have encountered the messy and annoying problems related much to data quality. 

It's an expected result. I have reminded it months ago but no one cares about it. Well, it finally comes out with no surprise. And everyone gets stuck and reports kinds of bugs. Data engineer is exhausted on putting out fires here and there.

That's not a healthy status. No one is willing to or able to dive down deeply into the database to clarify the tons of messy data.

I have to stand out to make things right.
