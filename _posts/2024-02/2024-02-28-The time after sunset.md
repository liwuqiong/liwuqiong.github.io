I drive home at about 19 o'clock, and have dinner. 

This is the time after sunset and before go to bed.

I don't think it's well utilized. I always watch TV with my family when having dinner. And after dinner, I feel a tired and no willingness to do anything. 

The whole time after sunset does not have outcome. I'm not saying that there should be no rest or entertainment. It's only because that in such a period, I can't bear such an amount of time unproductive or wasted in one day and next. 

I should develop a much efficient way of refreshing energy and mind.

I should boost my eagerness to succeed, devote my passion into the work, and push my limitation beyond the comfort zone.
