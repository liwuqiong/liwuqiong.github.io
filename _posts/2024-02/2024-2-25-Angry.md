Every weekend meeting makes me a little angry. I feel that I fall into another trap of working in a large company. 

I feel terrible every time when I realize this. I devote much of my time and effort but don't get the corresponding reward and dignity. 

It's urgent to speed up my own way. They are:

1. Indie hacker project with my own.
2. Find my entrepreneurial partner all over the world. 
3. Prepare to study aboard.

The main point is that I should focus the most important things. Don't put any attention on emotion or any worthless things.
