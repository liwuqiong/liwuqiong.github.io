When the planning period is finished and the to-do list is settled, the rest is just doing. 

When I throw myself into the work, just do one thing and then the next, without much thinking or wandering, I feel good and productive. 

That's the secret of sustaining a streaming momentum and status.

Besides, I don't want to be ordered by people who don't know the true state of affairs and don't do the detail work and don't go to the front line. 

I must control my own life and fate.
