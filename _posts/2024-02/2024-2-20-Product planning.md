Last night I slept at 3 a.m. for completing the left undone routine. 

Work at home the whole day. Feeling uncomfortable about eye and cheek. 

Overwhelmed by product planning. What kind of a business intelligence product do clients need and like? How can we use the power of AI into the working process? What features are the most urgently needed?

Besides, what annoys me is that too many unprofessional sound trying to influence the planning work.

Damn.
