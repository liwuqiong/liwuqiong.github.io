No matter what good or bad words I say about my life, I have to admit that in general and at every angle, it's a very happy one and definitely worthwhile living. 

So I have to learn stop judging and complaining.

Just do what's real important, and devote the whole energy into it.

Talk about things about how to improve the work, instead of complaining.
