Work is going on in progress. In the version 0.9, we add RAG feature to the original retrieval route, hoping that the accuracy would be at a high and stable level.

Besides, in TODAY, March 6th, I decided to launch the project X, which aims to the future apart from the project A(A1, A2, A3). 

This is the thing what I want to do about 15 years ago, and during these years, it comes out frequently like a swinging shadow but never ends in realistic or continuous actions. 

The reason is simple, I'm not determined enough. I don't have the courage to chase what I really want. In one word, I lost myself. 

But now, in the year of 2024, I must take it fucking seriously. I would devote enough energy and time into it. The next 10-20years may result from the execution of this decision. 

God bless me.
