I read a business plan file from Tencent in 2002. The analysis is profound and thorough. The author is just a project manager but acts like a real leader.

I always said that I wanted to be the one having the final decision. Now it's the answer: don't just "want". If that's your wish, then be realistic: Think and behave like a CEO.
