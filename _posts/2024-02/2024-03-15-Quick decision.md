I have a lot of decisions to make these days. Most of them are quite small ones, but I spend too much time. 

Then I know that there is an important capability for self-managers and entrepreneurs: make quick decision, make things move fast. If there's something wrong, leave them till later. 

Don't worry too much. Things are getting better in this way instead of a perfect planning and a thorough, deliberate decision ahead.

Don't spend too much time on trivial things.
