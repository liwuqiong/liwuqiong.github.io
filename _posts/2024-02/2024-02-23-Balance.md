It seems that the work of A1 are occupying all of my time from awaking to bedtime.

That's a really bad thing. In A1 I am just a co-founder and I don't feel happy about it really. I've done the most but got no dignity. 

And those people are accustomed to just say instead of doing the ground work. They stay away from the real work and the difficult work. They put strict deadlines and demands on workers, but never have that on themselves. 

Disgusted. 

So I need to make a balance.

And be quick to find my own way in which I have the final power. I believe I can do much better.
