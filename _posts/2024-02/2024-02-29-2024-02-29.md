Four year a time: day 29 in February.

It seems that the speed of time passing would be counted as four years' pace.

I read a paper saying that the reason of time passing faster as age growing is because people stop learning new things when they get old. 

I agree with that. Repetition is the killer of life. I'm always astonished by how time flies: what's happened just like yesterday is actually years ago. 

That's an indication and also an alert of how badly I lead my life. I get few new knowledge or skill. Many important things make few progress. I don't do something, let alone be somebody.

When I look back, I don't feel any connection between the past-me and now-me. I think that the past years' living is with no heart or real and specific goal. 

A special day.
