I have a daily routine. It's a list of must-do tasks that are the basics of one day. If the completion rate is well, I can say this day is not wasted. 

The tasks is 4-1 structured: 4 daily habits and 1 knowledge management process. 

Sometimes when work is busy, the routine tasks may be undone. And I will accomplish them in the later days.

Today I have done the routine tasks that are left in the Spring Festival. In those days at home, I do nothing but playing. That's how I spend time in holiday. 

But when back to work, I must devote my whole time and energy into it. And the start is competing the previous daily routine tasks.

It's an effective way to put myself in the right state and fire up the engine.
