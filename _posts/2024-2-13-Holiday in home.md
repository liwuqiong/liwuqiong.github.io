I go several places with my family these days. For example, I visit Kaifeng, an ancient city where many dynasties locate their capital. I also visit some famous parks in Zhengzhou. 

There are always too many people in tourist attractions when in holiday in China. So I've canceled some plans as I see the horrible pics showing "mountain people mountain sea". 

I like these days with my family, but the part I don't like is that the life in home is too comfortable and warm. I have no willingness to do anything except playing for fun. 

A delimma.
