I should remind myself to be focused repeatedly. 

If not, too much fragmented info would get in and overwhelm me. 

Ignore the rubbish thread or video on social media. Don't swipe the cellphone mindlessly like a zombie. 

Go back to the original point and regain the enthusiasm, refresh what's the most important, set the goal and just do it.

Be focused on my goal.
