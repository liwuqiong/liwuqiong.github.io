This week A1 project has made a progress in data asset. I have organized all the data tables and metrics, and built dozens of data cards. And there are some changes to be made after a discussion with our potential customer. We'll see this be in planning next week.

In content creation I've also written several articles, which uses less time than I expected. 

No progress in my learning python. Next week this line should be hurried up. 

I'm not happy about what I've treated in A1 project. But I should adjust my attitude. Don't be in a mood of a victim. That will harm my energy. Light thought, and light action.
