The coding work of the product's version 0.8 is near finished. And I start to examine and check the work the whole day. 

A lot of bugs or unpleasant user experiences. But still a big step forward. 

The work is tedious, and the communication is exhausted. 

Despite these difficulties, I'm determined to make out an excellent data product.
