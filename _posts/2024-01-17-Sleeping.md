A topic that's be mentioned again in a month.

My sleep in this week was bad. It went back to the sleeping late mode. However, the different part is that I get up early in the morning on 7 a.m, which means that I don't get enough sleeping hours in a day. 

So the bad effect comes: my energy in the day runs out in the afternoon, and I have to catch up on sleep in the noon. And this often takes too much time to 2 hours or even more because I'm too tired and the warm seat in the car. As such, the effective time in the afternoon left for me is just 2 hours. 

Catastrophe. 

I must end it, no matter how painful or in what ways.

Defend my energy and time. Use it wisely.
