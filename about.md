Hi, I'm Wq. I write this blog to record the journey of my pursuing and building the path towards the **real achievements and freedom**. 

Maybe just like you, I don't want to live the rest of life for someone else's goals.

An entrepreneur, analyst/product manager, writer and indie hacker... 

All tags are nothing more than a kind of restriction. 

I was and still am *an idiot*, which encourages me **keep learning and going**.
